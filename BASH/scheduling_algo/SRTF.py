"""
SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First) is a preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm that
always selects the process with the shortest remaining burst time among the available
processes at the current time. Unlike non-preemptive SJF, SRTF allows a new shorter
process to preempt the currently running one.

This approach reduces average waiting and turnaround time even further compared to
SJF, making it optimal in many scenarios. However, it may lead to starvation of
longer processes if shorter ones keep arriving. SRTF is best suited for environments
where process burst times are known or can be estimated accurately.
